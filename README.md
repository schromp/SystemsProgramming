# SystemsProgramming

These are my solutions to the [Systems Programming Bool](https://www.pearson.de/computer-systems-a-programmers-perspective-global-edition-9781292101767)

Due to time management issues these are more than suboptimal.
If I ever get back to these I have many things id like to do differently.

However I this has still been a very valuable and educational experience
